## Accomplished work
1. A table for storing contact data has been implemented. To implement the table, the QTableWidget class was chosen, which provides a wide range of functions for working with tables. The QPushButton class was used to create the buttons.
2. A button has been created to add an entry. Clicking on the button creates an empty row at the end of the table.
3. A record deletion button has been created. When clicked, the rows in which the cells are selected are deleted, in the case when no cells are selected, the last row is deleted.
4. A button and a text input field have been created for searching the table. The search is performed by substring in all cells of the table.
5. Verification of user-entered data is implemented, which is performed using functions based on regular expressions.
6. The data in the table is sorted by one column. Sorting is performed using the built-in functionality of the QTableWidget widget.
7. Implemented writing data to and reading from a .csv file. The field separator in a line is a semicolon.
